# MOJAthenaUDFs
### AWS ATHENA UDFs for Record Linkage

Need Java 1.8 / Maven installed. Installation of both through SDKMAN is recommended



### HOW TO BUILD JAR and create the lambda function:

- Build jar

    mvn package clean #to check if it compiles
    mvn clean install -DskipTests

- Create a lambda function (make sure that lambda role is created before this)

either use the web interface or the below command
    aws lambda create-function
    --function-name athenaudf
    --runtime java8
    --role arn:aws:iam::3242345446345:role/serverlessrepo-AthenaUserDefin
    --handler com.awssupport.athena.udfs.MOJAthenaUserDefinedFunctions
    --timeout 900
    --zip-file fileb://./target/MOJAthenaUserDefinedFunctions-1.0-SNAPSHOT --region eu-west-1

- Go to Athena and make sure that Console is pointing to Engine version 2

- Run below query on ATHENA to test UDF:

`USING EXTERNAL FUNCTION compress(input VARCHAR) RETURNS VARCHAR LAMBDA 'athenaudf' SELECT compress('Hello')`

### Progress

v.1.0.0

get this mechanism working / compiling and outputing a jar. 
Next step: Test that its working on Athena.

- double metaphone should be ready and working now

- Jaro Winkler from Apache Commons also compiles sucessfully and has a scalar interface , in the way UDFs work in Athena : 
it needs input of the form "TEXT_FROM_COL1####TEXT_FROM_COL2" where #### is the seperator of the two column strings 

As the documentation [see reference 1] points out
        Scalar UDFs only â€“ Athena only supports scalar UDFs, which process one row at a time and return a single column value. Athena passes a batch of rows, potentially in parallel, to the UDF each time it invokes Lambda
